# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management

# Introduction:

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner used to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It is developed by Tenable Network Security and is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers to evaluate the security posture of an organization.
Nessus can scan for vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, services, and network devices. It uses a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to identify weaknesses in systems and provides detailed information on how to mitigate or remediate them.
Nessus is used for remote scanning, comprehensive scanning, reporting, policy compliance, and integration. Nessus is used to aid organizations in identifying and prioritizing security vulnerabilities, and improving an organization's overall security posture.

# Purpose: 

In this project, I will be using Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities that lie within a Windows 10 operating system. I will then perform vulnerability remediation until the vulnerabilities are considered acceptable for the operating machine.


# Windows Virtual Machine Setup

The first thing I did was install the Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft website. I used Windows 10 as my operating system for this lab. This will allow me to install Windows 10 on VMWare Workstation.

After installing the Windows 10 ISO file. I opened VMWare Workstation and configured the settings before creating the VM.  I changed the network adapter settings to Bridged which will make it easier for the virtual machine to communicate with the local machine.

After finishing the Windows VM setup, I logged into Windows 10 and opened the command prompt to ensure that the VM can communicate with the local machine.  I first used the ipconfig command to get the IP address before testing the system’s connectivity. After doing this, I noticed that there wasn't any communication betewwn the VM and the local machine. So I configured the firewall settings.

# Nessus Vulnerability Scan

I scanned the virtual machine using the IP address I grabbed from the command prompt. I clicked on Create a new scan and landed on this page. As you can see, Nessus allows you to perform different types of vulnerability checks such as web application tests, mobile device scans, and network scans.

![Capture17](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/26a39a7c-dff9-43d8-beab-d30820370c1f)

On this page I created a new scan and entered the IP address of the VM in the Targets section.

![Capture18](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/0857e8e5-0967-4694-9588-2957f52cc928)

After starting the first scan, I noticed that the scanner detected a total of 32 vulnerabilites. 1 of the vulnerabilites was marked at a medium level rank. This was while the scanner was still running. 

![Capture20](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/78712e77-4668-464e-961f-841874273d55)

This was after the scanner was complete.

I took some time to do research on the highest ranked vulnerability. The vulnerability said SMB “Signing not required.” SMB (Server Message Block) signing is a security feature in Windows that ensures the authenticity and integrity of SMB packets sent between network devices. When SMB signing is enabled, a digital signature is added to the packets, preventing attackers from intercepting or modifying the data. If SMB signing is not required, it means that the network devices are not configured to enforce SMB signing on all SMB packets. This can potentially make the network vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts SMB packets and modifies them without detection.

# Credentialed Scan

I  configured the VM for the next scan which will be a credentialed scan. I went to Services on my VM and enabled the Remote Registry which allowed Nessus to connect to the VM’s registry and search for any insecure configurations.

A credentialed scan in Nessus refers to a scan that is performed with administrative or privileged credentials on the target system. By using privileged credentials, the scanner can access additional information and perform more in-depth testing of the target system, which can help identify potential vulnerabilities that may not be visible during an non-credentialed scan.

![Capture26](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/17a9ab15-db76-4ac6-8afb-8a76550d12d0)


In this step I created a key which will allow the remote account to connect to the operating system.  In the registry editor, I created another key that further disabled the user account control for the remote account.

![Capture31](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/5baff5e8-fd5a-44bb-9547-e2c1b2dfdf96)

![Capture32](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/bf96347e-633e-4ed5-8ae5-6a7bda2206d0)



After doing this, I went back to my local machine to perfom a credentialed scan on Nessus.

The credentialed scan performed a more in-depth vulnerability check and discovered more security vulnerabilities. Some of which are ranked high and critical. 

![Capture37](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/819d6f22-b7c5-4773-bfe5-197d261aec7d)




This is an image of the vulnerabilities after the credential scan.

This is a list of the high severity vulnerabilities. I clicked on one of them to get more information. 

![Capture39](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/410f897e-b822-438f-bf1d-148d09822432)

The vulnerability stated that the operating system has an outdated version of Windows Defender and needs to be updated. Ignoring this can leave the operating system exploitable to attackers, allowing them to cause to the system. It's always recommended for organizations to ensure that systems fully updates and have the latest patches in order to avoid security risks.

I noticed that some vulnerabilities were ranked as critical so I decided to get more information.


![Capture42](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/9f89ff9c-5f30-4cb0-8ce3-8820147ad67e)


According to this image, the Windows VM is missing a security update which leaves the system vulnerable to threats.

# Deprecated Software Installation

In this step, I installed an outdated version of Firefox for the next credentialed scan. This was a test to see what other vulnerabilities Nessus can detect.

![Capture51](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/dab74a00-6c89-41bd-b11e-03da6735c327)

This was after installing the old version of Mozilla Firefox. Just by the look of the opening page, you can tell that it is outdated.

<img src="https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/80315c3d-cdfa-40fb-98ea-8ef72b533177" alt="Deprecated Software Install" width="500" height="500">

I then started another credentialed scan on the virtual machine. And just as I expected, Nessus has discovered more vulnerabilities due to the outdated Mozilla Firefox that I installed. 

![Capture55](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/35bf8842-b232-4e4a-9eb4-87a208219e22)

Just as I predicted, Nessus identified multiple security gaps that are labeled to be critical. A system with this many vulnerabilities isn’t meant for use. 

<img src="https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/5a4f5a7e-7692-466d-a3ce-b072b309c214" alt="Vuln. Scan" width="500" height="500">

This is more infomation about one of the critical vulnerabilities in the system. Nessus identified that the Mozilla Firefox software is outdated and can lead to application crashes and even remote code execution.

# Remediation Process

For the remediation process, I first uninstalled the outdated Firefox browser.

![Capture63](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/08338592-103c-418b-8372-2e86cd980326)

I went to Windows settings on the VM to check for any missing updates in the operating system. After that, I ran updates on the virtual machine for the remediation process.

![Capture64](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/a0996b36-4b0b-498d-97e5-13fc4c204ccc)


![Capture67](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/b1500f21-5bb5-4b81-a354-9fcbe48eb3b8)


After the system finished updating, I started a final credentialed scan for the project. I expected Nessus to scan for less vulnerabilities than the last scan due to the Windows updates on the virtual machine.

![Capture69](https://github.com/obi298/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management/assets/90945162/562f3d51-2b94-4fe9-91bc-c80a7c58aea1)

As expected, Nessus discovered less vulnerabilities compared to the last scan due to the remediation process. There were less vulnerabilites ranked as high or critical.
