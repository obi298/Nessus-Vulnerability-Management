# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management

# Introduction:

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner used to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It is developed by Tenable Network Security and is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers to evaluate the security posture of an organization.
Nessus can scan for vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, services, and network devices. It uses a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to identify weaknesses in systems and provides detailed information on how to mitigate or remediate them.
Nessus is used for remote scanning, comprehensive scanning, reporting, policy compliance, and integration. Nessus is used to aid organizations in identifying and prioritizing security vulnerabilities, and improving the overall security posture.

# Purpose 

In this project, I will be using Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities that lie within a Windows 10 operating system. I will then perform vulnerability remediation until the vulnerabilities are considered acceptable for the operating machine.

The first thing I did was install the Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft website. I used Windows 10 as my operating system for this lab. This will allow me to install Windows 10 on VMWare Workstation.
