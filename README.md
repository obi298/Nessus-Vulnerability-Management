# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management

# Introduction:

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner used to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It is developed by Tenable Network Security and is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers to evaluate the security posture of an organization.
Nessus can scan for vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, services, and network devices. It uses a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to identify weaknesses in systems and provides detailed information on how to mitigate or remediate them.
Nessus is used for remote scanning, comprehensive scanning, reporting, policy compliance, and integration. Nessus is used to aid organizations in identifying and prioritizing security vulnerabilities, and improving an organization's overall security posture.

# Purpose: 

In this project, I will be using Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities that lie within a Windows 10 operating system. I will then perform vulnerability remediation until the vulnerabilities are considered acceptable for the operating machine.

The first thing I did was install the Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft website. I used Windows 10 as my operating system for this lab. This will allow me to install Windows 10 on VMWare Workstation.

After installing the Windows 10 ISO file. I opened VMWare Workstation and configured the settings before creating the VM.  I changed the network adapter settings to Bridged which will make it easier for the virtual machine to communicate with the local machine.

After finishing the Windows VM setup, I logged into Windows 10 and opened the command prompt to ensure that the VM can communicate with the local machine.  I first used the ipconfig command to get the IP address before testing the systemâ€™s connectivity. After doing this, I noticed that there wasn't any communication betewwn the VM and the local machine. So I configured the firewall settings.

After configuring the firewall settings, I went back to the command prompt to test the connection and saw that the virtual machine wass finally able to communicate with the local machine.
